Welcome to the Pig Game! A fun and simple dice game where luck and strategy go hand-in-hand. Roll the dice to accumulate points, but beware — rolling a 1 will end your turn and cost you all the points you've gathered in that round!

How to Play
The game involves two players who take turns rolling a dice. The first player to reach a set score (usually 100 points) wins the game.

Rules
On each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish.
The number rolled is added to their current round score.
A player can choose to “Hold” at any time to add their round score to their total score and end their turn.
BUT if a player rolls a 1:
Their turn is over.
They lose all points accumulated in that round.
No points are added to their total score.
Objective
Be the first player to reach the winning score (default is 100 points).
